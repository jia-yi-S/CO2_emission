# world map of Carbon emmision 
This is a map websit which can show co2 emission in each countries form 2099 to 1949.

> here is ML code done by my teammate:https://github.com/YiqingZhang317/CO2_emission



#Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
#download
```
git clone https://github.com/jia-yi-S/Co2-emission.git
```

# Steps to perform prediction
### For training the model using the existing csv data
Step-1: Create virtual environment
> vitualenv venv

Step-2: Install requirements
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Step-3: Train the model and generate pickle file of model for each country
> python prediction/model_train.py

Step-4: Perform prediction for given range of year and save it in a file
> python prediction/model_prediction.py

ECharts is a free, powerful charting and visualization library offering an easy way of adding intuitive, interactive, and highly customizable charts to your commercial products. It is written in pure JavaScript and based on <a href="https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender">zrender</a>, which is a whole new lightweight canvas library.

Now ECharts is an incubator project of Apache Software Foundation.

## Build

Build echarts source code:

Execute the instructions in the root directory of the echarts:
([Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required)

```shell
# Install the dependencies from NPM:
npm install

# If intending to build and get all types of the "production" files:
npm run release
# The same as `node build/build.js --release`

# If only intending to get `dist/echarts.js`, which is usually
# enough in dev or running the tests:
npm run build
# The same as `node build/build.js`

# Get the same "production" files as `node build/build.js`, while
# watching the editing of the source code. Usually used in dev.
npm run watch
# The same as `node build/build.js -w`

# Check the manual:
npm run help
# The same as `node build/build.js --help`
```

Then the "production" files are generated in the `dist` directory.

More custom build approaches can be checked in this tutorial: [Create Custom Build of ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/tutorial.html#Create%20Custom%20Build%20of%20ECharts) please.

## Documentation

Bootstrap's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://getbootstrap.com/>. The docs may also be run locally.

Documentation search is powered by [Algolia's DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/). Working on our search? Be sure to set `debug: true` in `site/docs/4.5/assets/js/src/search.js` file.

### Running documentation locally

1. Run through the [tooling setup](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/build-tools/#tooling-setup) to install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to compile CSS and JavaScript files, generate our docs, and watch for changes.
4. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

### Documentation for previous releases
